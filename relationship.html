								You love her. You really do. But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s gotten worse.
							</p>
                            <p>
                                She first brought it up when the two of you were on the verge of graduating college. A liberal arts major who’d just secured a gig starting next fall for a well-established dance group, she’d had enough of you always having to study for something or another. She’d been willing to make sacrifice after sacrifice for you, the latest being agreeing to move west so you could attend that law program you’d always dreamt of being accepted into—a dream that had come to fruition not two months ago. And for all she did, she wanted just one thing: to spend more time with you.
							</p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, you wanted to, and you told her so. But being an ambitious young man whose heart, mind, body, and soul had long been fixed on setting the new bar for your profession, spending time with her, especially during law school, was going to be difficult. And both of you knew it.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                So the two of you sat down and made that plan. The plan that was going to solve everything—it meant you could study as much as you had to, and still always be in touch with her. Step 1: you invested in matching iPhones. Step 2: you created profiles on a couple of the latest social media platforms. Step 3: you promised to use your new phones and the social media on them to keep in touch throughout your busy days. It seemed like the perfect idea.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Technology was going to rekindle your relationship.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                And for a while, it did. Or, at least, that’s what it seemed like. Those grueling, coffee-fueled nights at the library studying some case, memorizing some precedent, or understanding some rationale didn’t seem nearly as long when you could just launch an app and see the last place that she’d checked in or shoot her a quick heart emoji.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She was happier too. The <i>beep</i> from her phone, signaling that you had liked a post or messaged her was a welcome distraction from endless dance practices and tiring competition preparations. She loved that the two of you could always be together regardless of where you physically were, and so she began to post more, hoping that you would remotely interact more and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It really seemed like your plan was working perfectly. You had anticipated all of the hurdles you were currently facing, and so you were prepared to overcome them. Technology seemed to be making your life more livable by eliminating the need to invest time—time that you, especially, couldn’t otherwise spare—to connect with each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Technology was saving your relationship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But now, seven months into your first year of law school, things have changed. Sure, you still spend time together, and by no means do you consider your relationship to be unhealthy, but things aren’t as perfect anymore. Most of the problems aren’t a big deal—your schedules are lining up less and less, and is it just you or is your battery not lasting as long anymore?—but the thing that’s really begun to nag at you is why she doesn’t respond sometimes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After all, <i>you</i> are the busy one, right? Wasn’t <i>she</i> the one who had suggested getting these phones in the first place, so that you could “be together even when you were away”? And you know it isn’t just that she’s too busy to reply. That doesn’t explain the fact that she posts new pictures without responding to your texts. You can’t help but feel a little betrayed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Revenge has crossed your mind—you could cut her off and just focus on your work. But you always make a deliberate effort to reach out to her, almost hourly nowadays. After all, it’s your duty as a responsible, caring person to do at least that much. All you want is for her to put the same effort into this as you, but it’s clear that she isn’t.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why? You’ve asked that question more than a few times now, and you really don’t know for certain. But the chilling thought keeps coming back to you. You can’t push it out of your mind no matter how much you try, because every look at the blank notification screen is a crushing reminder. <i>What if she isn’t interested in me anymore?</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Technology is wounding your relationship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point, you know it’s not healthy. You shouldn’t be texting her this much. You shouldn’t constantly be waiting to see what she posts next. But you can’t help it—you have to find it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You know exactly what’s going on, but you haven’t said anything yet. What could you say, after all? <i>I know you’re cheating on me because I can read between the lines of how you ignore me?</i> No. You won’t make some half-assed try after weeks of watching and planning. You’re going to catch her when she slips up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You’re a hawk circling his prey. You’re waiting for her to make one wrong move on her social media, and you’ll have your proof. And it won’t be a private altercation. You’ve got it all planned out—how you’re going to publicize it on every single damn platform. You’re going to ruin her forever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What you don’t know is that she isn’t cheating on you. No, no, no. Not even close. She wouldn’t ever dream of betraying you, even if she was becoming anxious about your behavior. No, instead she’s been sacrificing her breaks from dance to get in touch with your parents to fly them here. She thinks it’s the only way for you to get better. She’s already explained it all to them—your recent gloominess, your unwillingness to talk. They’re coming down to help you next weekend, actually, to help remind you how—
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it doesn’t matter, does it? Sure, you loved her. You really did. But it didn’t get better. In fact, it only got worse. And now, it’s over. It’s all over.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Technology has killed your relationship.
                            </p>

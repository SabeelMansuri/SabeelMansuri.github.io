                                <p>Welcome to CSE6 XSD, an introductory computer science course offered by the Department of Extended Studies at UC San Diego. The course will cover a range of programming topics, including basic data types, loops and iteration, basic data structures, memory models, conditional statements, recursion, algorithm time complexity, analysis, class design, inheritance, and more.</p>

                                    <h4><s>Lectures</s> Problem Solving Sessions</h4>
                                    <p>Most of the course content will be presented in Stepik, which will serve as your interactive textbook.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>In place of traditional lectures, this course offers synchronous Problem Solving Sessions (PSSs) on Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 5 PM to 6 PM, during which the instructor will review key concepts, answer questions, and work through problems. These sessions will be recorded. While synchronous attendance is not required, <b>all students are expected to either attend synchronously or watch the recordings (or both)</b>. The PSSs will be held via the Zoom link available on Canvas.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Building a support system of friends with whom you can struggle and work through the challenges you encounter is one of the best ways to seek help. You will quickly learn how much you can figure out working together!</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>For additional help, there are two kinds of sessions you can attend. The first is open lab hours, where our fleet of tutors give one-on-one help with programming tasks and course content. This is the primary synchronous help mechanism, and is available at the times (and Zoom link) listed on Canvas.</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>The second is office hours, which are held by the TA at the times (and Zoom link) listed on Canvas. Office hours are a great place for any kind of question about the course, from help with your assignment to clarifications about material in lecture to questions beyond what we cover in the course. Instructor office hours are available by appointment.</p>

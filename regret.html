								Every parent’s mission is to leave the world a better place for their children. 
							</p>
                            <p>
                                You failed.
							</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px">
                                * * *
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                She’ll wake up at half past five. She won’t be first in line, but you’ll have to forgive her. A mother needs her sleep. In any case, she’s been doing this for two years now—she’s got the hang of it, she’ll be on time. She’ll get in line, wait twenty-seven minutes, and declare herself.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                <i>House 8812. Residency of five. Two children, nine and eleven. F - solar engineer, M - homemaker. Additional: GF - seventy-one.</i> She’ll hear the clicking and clacking of her family—her beloved children, husband, and father—being algorithmically reduced to a statistic behind the reinforced-glass wall.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                And she’ll pray. She’ll pray the number is higher today. <i>Please, oh please let it be higher!</i> she’ll think, over and over until—<i>88</i>. Today the family is in the 88th percentile and will receive a ration of food reflecting that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She’ll take the slip engraved with <i>88</i> to the second and final station. The sun will just be creeping up as she’ll hand the paper and her payment card to the guard, who’ll slide it to the ever-rotating man behind the counter. <i>88</i>, he’ll confirm after swiping her card, swiveling around, and grabbing a paper bag near the front of the assembly line. He’ll pass the bag and her card to the guard, who’ll hand them to her with a monotoned, <i>
                                Thanks</i>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She’ll head back to the house, wake up her children and husband for school and work, and open her newly-acquired bag. Inside, she’ll find a small can of hydrogenated cereal, two papayas (labeled “extra-extra-large”), three pouches of Ultra-Nutrit potato mash, four slices of soy bread, and a small carton of almond milk. A few years ago she would have sighed, <i>That’s it? For five of us? For the whole day? Fuck.</i> But now, she won’t. She’s used to this new form of normal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She’ll begin the daily rationing: She’ll split the cereal for the kids and add a quarter of the almond milk in each bowl (barely enough to wet the top layer, but better than nothing). Then, she’ll toast two pieces of the soy bread, one for her husband and one for her father, whom she’ll give the rest of the milk to. And finally, she’ll pack half a papaya for each of her children and her husband for lunch, and kiss her loved ones goodbye. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, it’ll be nap time. She won’t be tired, but she’ll conserve more calories by resting. So she’ll wheel her father back into his room and head upstairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her husband will take the two kids to school on his way to work, driving—as much as one can drive an autonomous car—their recently purchased Tesla Vagabond. It’s a posh car, near the top of the luxury sedan class, and they’ve opted for the highest trim model. Her husband’s well-paying job as an engineer for the now-booming solar industry can afford it. Plus, when they’re in that car their problems seem farther and stomaches seem fuller, perhaps with pride or perhaps with ignorance. Still, every bump that suspension kills and every blind-spot that mirror detects reminds them they’ve invested in a great product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then again, what were they going to do with the money? Buy more food? Good one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On most days, such as today, her husband will be able to get off work a bit early and pick up the kids on his way back home. She, having expected this, will have prepared the family’s final meal of the day, which will consist of whatever remains in their daily ration bag. Today, that’ll be two pieces of bread, half a papaya, and the three pouches of mash. She’ll divide everything for the family, again prioritizing the children (three-quarters of a pouch of mash each!) and settling for the scraps herself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After their linner (a meal that past generations had once split into lunch and dinner), she’ll send her kids to finish their homework, and the adults will sit down to talk. And talk they will, about politics and fashion and technology. About journalism and weather—anything that will take their minds off their still-hungry stomachs. They’ll try, and yes, sometimes with some success, to fill their stomachs with the potency of family. And so the day will come to a close, with the family perhaps underfed, but nonetheless together. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was the best cure, people had come to realize—just don’t think about food, and it won’t matter as much. And so everyone kept themselves preoccupied, and when they finally couldn’t—when the day was over—they didn’t hesitate to sleep. No one hears their stomach growl in their sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, she’ll have a few things to put in order first. She’ll place the dishes in the dishwasher, double-check that her AssistantPro will wake her at 5:30 the next morning, and place her thumb on the scanner to activate their security system. Then, she’ll head upstairs, lay down next to her husband, and let her mind wander to the sound of his gentle breath. She’ll be the last to close her eyes, once she’s convinced her family members have all gone to sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px">
                                * * *
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But she’ll be wrong. 
                            <p>
                                You see, you don’t sleep much nowadays; the burden of knowing that the hell unfolding before your eyes is your fault keeps them from drooping. Yes, you’re awake at five, listening to your daughter leave every morning to get the daily ration. Yes, you’re awake every afternoon, watching her clean the house on an empty stomach. And, yes, you’re awake every night, accepting that all of this is, at least partially, your fault.
                            <p>
                                You were warned. You were told what would happen—news reports, scientific papers, and multimodal pieces told you what would happen if you kept consuming irresponsibly. <i>Food shortage is imminent!</i>, they used to say, <i>we need to invest in a solution—we need to do it now! </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               But no, you and your generation decided that social media and TV shows and the internet were all more important than considering the future. <i>Bullshit</i>, you would scoff, <i>my supermarket is stocked with food.</i> Oh, how you miss supermarkets. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Perhaps if you had taken this issue seriously and realized that biotechnology was your people’s last chance at preserving the world they knew, your grandchildren would know what it’s like to be able to choose the food they eat. Perhaps they would have lived in a world where the government didn’t have to regulate food because of its sheer shortage. And perhaps all the money your son-in-law made could have actually filled their stomachs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               And besides all that, besides the better lives your children and your grandchildren would have had, perhaps you would have been able to sleep at night knowing you had been a good parent.
                            </p>
